                  To empower people—especially in underserved
                  communities—through practical, accessible technology. I aim to
                  build tools that promote self-sufficiency, lifelong learning,
                  and resilience in the face of social and structural
                  challenges.

                  To grow into a well-rounded human—mentally, physically,
                  spiritually, and intellectually—while building technology that
                  connects disciplines like engineering, agriculture,
                  self-defense, and education. Through disciplined action and
                  meaningful software, I hope to inspire others to pursue
                  independence, purpose, and community-driven change.
