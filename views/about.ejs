              I'm a **mechatronics engineer** and **software developer** with a
              passion for building cool projects, whether it's in **robotics,
              software development, IoT, or aquaponics farming**.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive on challenges and am continuously expanding my knowledge.
              With a background in **mechatronics engineering, software
              engineering, and networking,** I enjoy working on tech that pushes
              the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have a strong interest in self-improvement, psychology, and
              leveraging technology for human well-being. My long-term vision
              includes working on AI, software, and robotics projects that can
              make a positive impact in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding or building, youâ€™ll likely find me
              **practicing martial arts** or researching innovative solutions to
              improve our everyday lives.
