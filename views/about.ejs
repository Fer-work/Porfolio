                I'm a **mechatronics engineer** and **software developer** with
                a passion for building cool projects, whether it's in
                **robotics, software development, IoT, or aquaponics farming**.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thrive on challenges and am continuously expanding my
                knowledge. With a background in **mechatronics engineering,
                software engineering, and networking,** I enjoy working on tech
                that pushes the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also have a strong interest in self-improvement, psychology,
                and leveraging technology for human well-being. My long-term
                vision includes working on AI, software, and robotics projects
                that can make a positive impact in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding or building, youâ€™ll likely find me
                **practicing martial arts** or researching innovative solutions
                to improve our everyday lives.
